# ---- Certificates ----
#
# HTTP/3 always operates using TLS, meaning that running a WebTransport over
# HTTP/3 server requires a valid TLS certificate.  The easiest way to do this
# is to get a certificate from a real publicly trusted CA like
# <https://letsencrypt.org/>.
# https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/encrypt-in-transit/enable-https
# contains a detailed explanation of how to achieve that.
#
# As an alternative, Chromium can be instructed to trust a self-signed
# certificate using command-line flags.  Here are step-by-step instructions on
# how to do that:
#
#   1. Generate a certificate and a private key:
        # openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout certificate.key \
        #         -x509 -out certificate.pem -subj '/CN=Test Certificate' \
        #         -addext "subjectAltName = DNS:localhost"
#
#   2. Compute the fingerprint of the certificate:
        # openssl x509 -pubkey -noout -in certificate.pem | \
        #         openssl rsa -pubin -outform der | \
        #         openssl dgst -sha256 -binary | \
        #         #   xxd -p -c 256 > localhost.hex
        #         base64
#       Ther result will now be now exported as hex
#      The result should be a base64-encoded blob that looks like this:
#          "Gi/HIwdiMcPZo2KBjnstF5kQdLI5bPrYJ8i3Vi6Ybck="
#
#   3. Pass a flag to Chromium indicating what host and port should be allowed
#      to use the self-signed certificate.  For instance, if the host is
#      localhost, and the port is 4433, the flag would be:
#         --origin-to-force-quic-on=localhost:4433
#
#   4. Pass a flag to Chromium indicating which certificate needs to be trusted.
#      For the example above, that flag would be:
#         --ignore-certificate-errors-spki-list=Gi/HIwdiMcPZo2KBjnstF5kQdLI5bPrYJ8i3Vi6Ybck=
#
# See https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/run-chromium-with-flags for
# details on how to run Chromium with flags.
